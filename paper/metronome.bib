I discuss the Spanish romance as an international European genre, and show how this verse form’s distinctive features were transferred into Russian poetry and how the Russian version – or, rather, several Russian versions – of this form came into being. I pay special attention to the genesis of the stanza composed of a regular sequence of feminine (F) and masculine (m) clausulae FFFm. In Johann Gottfried Herder’s Der Cid, this clausula pattern was combined with unrhymed trochaic tetrameters, but, in early twentieth-century Russia, it emancipated from this metrical form, having retained the semantic leitmotifs of the Spanish romance, as well as its “Spanish” theme. I contextualize other translation equivalents of romance verse and compare them to the original Spanish verse form. I show (1) which forms poets used in translating romance verse and how those forms correlate (formally and functionally) with the original meter. Further, I discuss (2) when and how the trochaic tetrameters rhyming on even lines (XRXR) – originally used in translations of Spanish romances in German and English poetry – became the equivalent of romance verse in the Russian tradition. Finally, I demonstrate (3) how, in Konstantin Balmont’s translations of Spanish poetry, the FFFm clausula pattern lost its connection with trochee. After Balmont, other poets of the Silver Age of Russian literature started using it in original non-trochaic compositions to express “Spanish” semantics.},

However, there is one potential textual fingerprint stylometry tends to ignore: versification, or the very making of language into verse. Using poetic texts in three different languages (Czech, German, and Spanish), Petr Plecháč asks whether versification features like rhythm patterns and types of rhyme can help determine authorship. He then tests its findings on two unsolved literary mysteries. In the first, Plecháč distinguishes the parts of the Elizabethan verse play The Two Noble Kinsmen written by William Shakespeare from those written by his coauthor, John Fletcher. In the second, he seeks to solve a case of suspected forgery: how authentic was a group of poems first published as the work of the nineteenth-century Russian author Gavriil Stepanovich Batenkov? This book of poetic investigation should appeal to literary sleuths the world over.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in cultural analytics and large-scale computational studies of art, literature and film often show that long-term change in the features of artistic works happens gradually. These findings suggest that conservative forces that shape creative domains might be underestimated. To this end, we provide the first large-scale formal evidence of the association between poetic meter and semantics in 18-19th century European literatures, using Czech, German and Russian collections with additional data from English poetry and early modern Dutch songs. Our study traces this association through a series of unsupervised classifications using the abstracted semantic features of poems that are inferred for individual texts with the aid of topic modeling. Topics alone enable recognition of the meters in each observed language, as may be seen from the same-meter samples clustering together (median Adjusted Rand Index between 0.48 and 1 across traditions). In addition, this study shows that the strength of the association between form and meaning tends to decrease over time. This may reflect a shift in aesthetic conventions between the 18th and 19th centuries as individual innovation was increasingly favored in literature. Despite this decline, it remains possible to recognize semantics of the meters from past or future, which suggests the continuity in meter-meaning relationships while also revealing the historical variability of conditions across languages. This paper argues that distinct metrical forms, which are often copied in a language over centuries, also maintain long-term semantic inertia in poetry. Our findings highlight the role of the formal features of cultural items in influencing the pace and shape of cultural evolution.},

Both the public understanding of folklore and the ways it is studied by folklorists continue to be affected by the nature of its emergence.

As a field invented by antiquarians, the social emplacement of these virtuosi is investigated and the politics of culture of early modern Europe is brought to bear on nationalistic movements and tied to the present through the spectre of wars of national formation. The argument focuses on how folkloristic thinking has encouraged nationalistic movements, and on how folklorists might begin to think about a new politics of culture, one based on pluralist rather than nationalist perspectives.},

The system is being used in the building of the Corpus of Czech Verse (hereinafter CCV), which at present contains 1 689 Czech books of poetry (over 2.5 million lines) from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In contrast to standard language corpora, in each lexical unit are not only the lemma and morphological tag attributes assigned but they also contain a phonetic transcription; furthermore, the attributes metre (iamb, trochee…), length (number of feet), ending (feminine, masculine…) and metrical pattern are assigned to each verse line. At higher levels rhyme pairs (or n-some) and fixed forms (sonnet, rondel, etc.) are annotated. Here we will focus on components providing phonetic and metrical annotation: (1) the F-component, whose task is to derive the phonetic transcription from the input data, (2) the G-component, whose task is to generate a set of all possible metrical interpretations of these data, and (3) the M-component, whose task is to select from this set the final interpretation. Automatic analysis has so far been limited to accentual-syllabic (hereinafter AS) and monometric poems – i. e., poems consisting of repetitions and variations of a single metrical pattern (though AS imitations of some quantitative meters are recognized).},

	abstract = {Recognition of poetic meters is not a trivial task, since metrical labels are not a closed set of classes. Outside of classical meters, describing the metrical structure of a poem in a large corpus requires expertise and a shared scienti昀椀c theory. In a situation when both components are lacking, alternative and continuous measures of regularity can be envisioned. This paper focuses on poetic rhythm to propose a simple entropy-based measure for poem regularity using counts of non-stressed intervals. The measure is validated using subsets of a well-annotated Russian poetic corpus, prose, and quasi-poems (prose chopped into lines). The regularity measure is able to detect a clear di昀昀erence between various organizational principles of texts: average entropy rises when moving from accentual-syllabic meters to accentual variations to free verse and prose. Interval probabilities, when taken as a vector of features, also allow for classi昀椀cation at the level of individual poems. This paper argues that distinguishing between meter as a cultural idea and rhythm as an empirical sequence of sounds can lead to better understanding of form recognition and prosodic annotation problems.},

The analysis of the annotations provides a clear picture of the process of implementing the new poetic form into Dutch poetic tradition, and of its different stages. The development of iambic metre was a gradual process that required various attempts; this can be well observed when comparing Dutch poems from a 100 year time window. While syllabic instances can be observed among the first attempts, most of the earlier poems are not isosyllabic and have a rather varied syllable length. This study shows that isosyllabicity developed together with iambicity. Finally, automatic poetry annotation allows for testing and validating theoretical hypotheses and for investigating literary questions with the aid of large amount of data.},

As a result of the transfer of iambic verse from one tradition to another, the highest degree of correspondence between meter and language is achieved. The utmost level of verse metricality was especially successfully embodied in the German and later also in the early Russian iambic poetry. However, the evolution and the further transfer of iamb on the East of the Continent significantly modifies the principles of interaction between metrical canon and language prosody.},

	abstract = {Analyzing poetry with automatic tools has great potential for improving verse-related research. Over the last few decades, this field has expanded notably and a large number of tools aiming at analyzing various aspects of poetry have been developed. However, the concrete connection between these tools and traditional scholars investigating poetry and metrics is often missing. The purpose of this article is to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive survey of the automatic poetry analysis tools available for European languages. The tools are described and classified according to the language for which they are primarily developed, and to their functionalities and purpose. Particular attention is given to those that have open-source code or provide an online version with the same functionality. Combining more traditional research with these tools has clear advantages: it provides the opportunity to address theoretical questions with the support of large amounts of data; also, it allows for the development of new and diversified approaches.},

	abstract = {This article demonstrates that metre is a privileged indicator of authorial style in classical Latin hexameter poetry. Using only metrical features, classification experiments are performed between the works of six authors using four different machine-learning models. The results showed a pairwise classification accuracy of at least 90\% with samples as small as ten lines and no greater than seventy-five lines (up to around 500 words). In a multiclass setting, classification accuracy exceeded 95\% for all four algorithms when using eighty-one-line chunks. These sample sizes are an order of magnitude smaller than those typically recommended for BOW (‘bag of words’) or n-gram approaches, and the reported accuracy is outstanding. Additionally, this article explores the potential for outlier (forgery) detection, or ‘one-class classification’. As an example, analysis of the disputed Aldine Additamentum (Sil. Ital. Pun. 8:144–223) concludes (P \&lt; 0.0001) that the metrical style differs significantly from that of the rest of the poem.},
