From fairest creatures we desire increase,;0W10W1 0W1W01W01W
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,;0W10W1 0W1W0W10W1W
But as the riper should by time decease,;1W0W0W10W 1W0W1W01W
His tender heir might bear his memory:;0W10W1W 0W1W0W101W
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,;0W1W01 0W0W1W1W0W1W
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,;1W0W0W1W 0W1010W1W
Making a famine where abundance lies,;10W0W1 0W1W010W1W
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,;1W0W0W1W 0W1W0W101W
And only herald to the gaudy spring,;0W10W1 0W1W0W10W1W
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,;01W1W0W1W W10W1W01W
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:;0W10W1W 0W1W0W101W
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,;10W0W1W 0W1W0W10W1W
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.;0W1W0W0W1W 0W0W1W0W1W
;
;
;
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,;0W10W1 0W1W01W0W1W
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,;0W1W0W1 0W1W0W10W1W
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,;0W1W0W1 01W0W1W0W1W
Will be a totter'd weed of small worth held: ;0W1W0W1 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,;1W0W1W0W 1W0W0W10W1W
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days ;1W0W0W1 0W1W0W10W1W
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,;0W1W01W 0W1W0W10W1W
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.;1W0W010W1W 0W10W1W
How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,;0W1W0W1W 01W0W10W1W
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine;0W1W0W1 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,';0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W01W
Proving his beauty by succession thine!;10W0W1 0W1W010W1W
This were to be new made when thou art old,;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.;0W1W0W1W 1W0W0W1W0W1W
;
;
Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest;1W0W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1xW
Now is the time that face should form another;1W0W0W1W 0W1W0W1W01xW
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,;0W1W01W 0W1W0W1W01xW
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.;0W1W01W0W1W 01W0W1xW
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W01W1W
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?;01W0W01W 0W0W101W
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Of his self-love, to stop posterity? ;0W1W01W 0W1W0101W
Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee;0W1W0W1 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;0W1W0W1 0W10W1W0W1W
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,;0W1W0W1 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.;01W0W10W 1W0W10W1W
But if thou live, remembered not to be,;0W1W0W1W 010W1W0W1W
Die single and thine image dies with thee.;0W10W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
;
;
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend;010W101W 0W1W0W1W
Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?;01W0W1W 0W10W101W
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,;01W01W0W10W 1W0W1W
And being frank she lends to those are free:;x1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse;0W10W10 W1W0W1W01W
The bounteous largess given thee to give?;0W10W1 0W10W1W0W1W
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use;100W1 01W0W1W0W1W
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?;0W1W0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W
For having traffic with thy self alone,;0W1W0W1W0W1W 0W1W01W
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:;1W0W0W1W 0W1W0W1W01W
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,;0W1W0W10W1W 1W0W0W1W
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?;1W0100W1 0W1W0W1W
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,;1W01W10W1W0W1W0W1W
;
;
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame;1W0W1W 1W0W10W1W0W1W
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,;0W10W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
Will play the tyrants to the very same;0W1W0W10W 1W0W10W1W
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;0W1W01W 0W10W1W01W
For never-resting time leads summer on;0W1010W1W 0W10W1W
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;0W10W10W 1W01W0W1W
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,;0W1W0W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:;10W01W 0W10W10W1W
Then were not summer's distillation left,;0W1W0W1 0W1010W1W
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,;0W10W10W1W 0W1W0W1W
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,;10W01W 0W10W1W01W
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:;0W1W0W1W 010W1W0W1W
Leese but their show their substance still lives sweet.;1W0W0W1W 0W10W0W1W1W
;
;
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,;1W0W0W1 0W10W1W01W
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distilled:;0W1W0W10W 0W1W0W01W
Make sweet some vial treasure thou some place;0W1W0W10W 10W1W0W1W
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed.;0W10W10W 1W0W1W01W
That use is not forbidden usury,;0W1W0W1W 010W101W
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;0W10W1W 0W1W0W10W1W
That's for thy self to breed another thee,;0W1W0W1W 0W1W010W1W
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;1W0W0W10W 1W0W1W0W1W
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,;0W1W0W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:;0W1W0W1W 0W1W010W1W
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W01W
Leaving thee living in posterity?;10W0W10W 1W0101W
Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair;0W1W01W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.;0W0W1W10W 1W0W1W0W1W
;
;
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light;1W0W0W10W 1W0W10W1W
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye;0W1W0W10W1W 0W10W1W
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,;0W10W1W 0W1010W1W
Serving with looks his sacred majesty ;1W0W0W1W 0W10W101W
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,;0W10W1W 1W01W10W1W
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,;010W0W1W 1W0W10W1W
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,;0W10W1W 01W0W10W1W
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:;010W1W 0W10W101W
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,;0W1W0W10W1W 0W10W1W
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,;0W10W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are;0W1W 0W10W 1W010W1W
From his low tract, and look another way:;0W1W0W1W 0W1W010W1W
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon;0W1W 01W010W1W0W1W
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.;01W0W1W 01W0W1W0W1W
;
;
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?;10W0W1W 0W1W0W10W1xW
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:;1W0W1W0W1W 1W01W0W1W
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,;0W1W0W1W0W1W01W0W1xW
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?;0W1W01W 0W10W1W01W
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,;1W0W1W01W 1W010W1W
By unions married, do offend thine ear,;0W10W10W 1W01W0W1W
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds;0W1W0W10W1W0W 1W01W
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. ;0W101W0W1W 0W1W0W1W
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,;1W0W0W1W 0W10W1W01xW
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;1W0W0W1W 0W10W101W
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,;010W1W 0W1W0W10W1xW
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:;0W1W0W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,;0W10W1W0W10W 10W1W
Sings this to thee: 'Thou single wilt prove none.';1W0W0W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
;
;
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye,;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W10W1W
That thou consum'st thy self in single life?;0W1W01W 0W1W0W10W1W
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,;1W0W0W101W 0W1W0W1W
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;0W1W0W1W0W 1W0W10W1W
The world will be thy widow and still weep;0W1W0W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,;0W1W0W1W0W1W 0W1W01W
When every private widow well may keep;0W10W1 0W10W1W0W1W
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:;0W10W1W 0W10W1W0W1W
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend;1W0W0W10W 1W0W1W0W1W
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;1W0W0W1W 0W1W0W1W01WxW
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,;0W10W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
And kept unused the user so destroys it.;0W1W01W0W10W1W01WxW
No love toward others in that bosom sits;0W1W10W1 0W1W0W10WxW
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.;1W0W01W 0W10W1W01W
;
;
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1xW
Who for thy self art so unprovident.;1W0W0W1W 0W1W0101W
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,;1W0W0W1W 0W1W01W0W1xW
But that thou none lov'st is most evident:;0W1W0W0W1W 0W0W101W
For thou art so possessed with murderous hate,;0W1W0W1W 01W0W10W1W
That 'gainst thy self thou stick'st not to conspire,;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W01W
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate;10W0W10W1W 0W101W
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.;1W0W01W 0W1W0W1W01W
O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:;0W1W0W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?;0W1W0W10W1 0W1W0W1W
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,;1W0W0W10W1W 10W0W1W
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:;0W1W01W 0W1W010W1W
Make thee another self for love of me,;1W0W01W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.;0W10W1W 0W1W0W1W0W1W
